# weldDetection
Welding image detection using OpenCv (library required).
Work in progress to detect welding images.

This solution was developed in order to find welding images acquired from a welding factory.
The problem was finding welds in a variety of non-weld images spread in several folders.
So, it automizes the search of those specific images.
